### Hey there,

My homework 2 works 'partially' where it duplicates on the first collision
and will not duplicate afterwards. However, I all the other game functionality work.

Initially, you will have a 'start' screen where it prompts you to 'game' mode.
In 'game' mode, you will be able to play pong, keep track of the scores, and if you would like
press 'select' button to pause the game. From 'pause' mode, you can continue to the game or
restart the game.

## Instructions on how to play:
* Press 'UP' to go up, and 'DOWN' key to go down, to control right side of the paddle
* Press 'A' to go up, and 'B' to go down, to control left side of the paddle

* Press 'START' to start game
* Press 'SELECT' to pause game

### Winning state:
* If either left or right side players reach a score of 5, the game ends.

-----ENJOY-----
